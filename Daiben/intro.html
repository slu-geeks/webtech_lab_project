Substance abuse had always been a major problem of any country around the world,whether it's on alcohol,
tobacco or drugs. Especially for us here in the philippines, wherein according to
<b>Jodesz Gavilan</b> of <i>rappler</i> we have an estimated number of 1.8 million current drug users which is
around 2 percent of the current Philippine population. Which is quite scary because despite of all the action that was
done by <b>president Duterte</b> to suppress and eliminate all the drugs here in the philippines, this number is
still too much, but there's also no denying of the fact that we are currently on the verge of a major break
through to a drug free country thank to our current President <b>Rodrigo Duterte.</b> Ever since <b>Duterte</b>
started the war on drugs, the Philippines had been the center of all the media around the world when it come to drug
suppression, because of all the killing or extra judicial killings a term that was used by his critics.
<br>
And so to avoid all this killing we decided to create this web page for those of you guys that are currently being addicted
to this substances, to help you and guide you. By browsing on this web page, we hope you will be aware about the possible consequences
that might happen to you or to the people around you.
