	<h1>Our encounters with substance abusers</h1>
    <h2> Why use cigarettes?</h2>
    <img src = cigarettes.jpg alt = "cigarettes" width = 300px>
    <p>- One friend told me that he uses cigarettes, because he saw it from his other friends,
    	he thinks that it's cool until he realizes that he's being addicted to it and keep on
    	smoking with his friends. </p>
	<p>- Another friend said that it is a bond between friends if you smoke cigarettes, you all
		come along and smoke cigarettes when it's a break time and you share your ideas or converse with them
		and it is fun so they smoke and get addicted or get used to it. </p>
	<p>- Another told me that it can take all your problems away, like it can temporarily cure
		stress and everything, it can also help solve problems in your situation.
		It can be addicting because it's a temporary escape from stress and their problems
		that is why they are addicted to it and until now, they smoke cigarettes without knowing the effects on their body.
		They only focus on the mind and not the body.

    <h2> Why use marijuana?</h2>
    <img src = marijuana.jpg alt = "marijuana" width = 300px>
 	<p> -People whom I interviewed told me that they are using it because of stress, same case
 		in cigarettes but the effect of marijuana is stronger and it lasts longer, which makes
 		it addictive. Others told me that it can make you intelligent, get higher on grades and thinking,
 		in which is partially correct because they told me if that you use this marijuana it makes you wonder
 		on how things are going, like reality, politics, nature, space, time and deep stuff that a normal person
 		wouldn't randomly think about it. </p>
	<p>- Other friends told me that they use this as a medical treatment from their sickness, like pneumonia,
		Parkinson disease, epilepsy, arthritis, and others. It can calm their nervous system, which they told me;
		because of the THC (tetra hydra cannabinol), it can stimulate the brain and calm them down.</p>
	<p>- Some friends also told me that it could help relax your body and mind; it can help you sleep more and stay
		cool for the day. They told me it's just that great to use this marijuana, because it helps people chill down,
		without worrying about anything, it's addictive but we are not abusing it, they say. They told me that using
		this marijuana is good for the heart as long as you're not abusing this drug, but who knows?</p>
	<p>- Another friend told me that it can make you happy and energetic, in which you only think of the happy
		thoughts and leaving the bad things behind him, it's like living the happy moment and it can make you remember
		all the happy thoughts that you had in the past. “It can also unravel of what you love doing, and hate the
		things that you hate doing, it's like a key to your gate in which you can see what you love and what you hate. 
		He said.</p>
	<h2> Why use shabu?</h2>
	<img src = shabu.jpg alt = "shabu" width = 300px>
  	<p>- I had a friend that knew an abuser of shabu, and that it destroyed his mind and body, that his thinking was
  		dangerous and his body got thinner after abusing all those chemicals to his body. It's dangerous and horrifying
  		to see a friend to be eaten by a drug that is so dangerous, it's like I lost a brother, he said. He also said
  		that being addicted to it would make you poor and you will steal money or sell everything you have as long as
  		you have that chemical (shabu) and that you are fine. He said that his friend would kill only for that chemical (shabu).
