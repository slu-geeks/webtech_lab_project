	   	The use of drugs in order to alter the physiological and psychological functioning
		in an individual has had a long history. Cannabis was grown in China for medicinal
		purposes as early as 4000 BC while the Incan civilization in South America was known
		to have worshipped cocaine (Isralowitz, 2004). Other drugs such as heroin and
		amphetamines have a more recent history. The production, sale, and use of illicit drugs
		remain to be a global problem a full century after the first drug control meeting in
		Shanghai, China (UNODC, 2009).

		The adverse effects of drug use to society, in general, and to the individual, in
		particular, are well-known and widely documented in the scientific literature. For
		example, a few studies have established a positive relationship between drug use and
		crime and violence, although the precise role of drugs is less clear (e.g. Corman &
		Mocan, 2000; Fagan, 1993; Goldstein, 1985). At the individual level, drug abuse affects
		one’s physical, psychological, and social well-being (e.g. Choi & Pearl, 1989; Jackson et
		al., 2006; Volkow, 2004). Drug abuse is also a serious economic burden to the State
		because of the staggering costs (health care, productivity loss, crime, etc.) associated with
		drug abuse (Cartwright, 1999).

		It is often said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In addition,
		many treatment modalities are expensive, labor-intensive, and plagued by high rates of
		recidivism (Botvin & Griffin, 2005). It is primarily for these reasons that the prevention
		aspect of the drug abuse problem is emphasized and advocated by many experts. Put
		simply, prevention offers a logical alternative to treatment.
		Botvin and Griffin (2005) classify prevention approaches into five categories,
		namely information dissemination, affective education approaches, alternatives
		approaches, social resistance skills approaches, and competency enhancement
		approaches. Preventive drug education programmes use one or a combination of the
		aforementioned approaches.

		This paper traces the development of drug prevention education programmes,
		with special emphasis on the theoretical bases and pedagogical approaches adopted by
		these programmes. In addition, the development of preventive drug education
		programmes in selected ASEAN member-states and other countries are briefly described.
		Finally, this paper attempts to provide a glimpse of the direction that preventive drug
		education is headed to based on recent developments in the fields of education, medicine,
		and the social sciences.
