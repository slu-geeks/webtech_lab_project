  	<p>
	    Different human cultures have engaged in non-medical drug use to stimulate,
		sedate, or elate since pre-historic times (Escohotado, 1999). The problem of drug abuse,
		however, is a relatively recent phenomenon in comparison. It follows that preventive 
		drug education is also recent compared to other subjects such as mathematics, science,
		and history. Horan (1974) stated that the purpose of drug education was threefold,
		namely to (1) increase knowledge about drugs, (2) promote healthy attitudes toward the
		use of drugs, and (3) decrease (potential) drug abuse behavior in the general population.
		However, he was also the first to concede that this statement was fraught with conceptual
		and empirical problems, as the history of drug education, briefly described in the
		succeeding paragraphs, would bear out.
	</p>
	<p>
		An early form of drug education could be traced in the 1880s when so-called
		temperance groups such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)
		associated many societal problems to alcohol consumption and its legal status and, thus,
		to further their anti-alcohol advocacy, they developed teaching materials (named
		'Scientific Temperance Instruction') for implementation in schools in North America
		(Tupper, 2008a; Tupper, 2008b). Although alcohol was the main focus of WCTU's
		efforts, they also condemned tobacco, opium and other drug use and advocated
		abstinence from all mind-altering substances (WCTU, no date). As WCTU is a moral
		crusader, it sees drug use as a moral issue and their users as wicked and deserving
		punishment (Marlatt, 1996).
	</p>
	<p>
		The 'Scientific Temperance Instruction' movement eventually lost public and
		political support and its use in schools declined by the 1920s. In 1926, the United States
		hosted the first World Conference on Narcotics Education, which brought international
		experts together to talk about how best to promote the message that drug use is
		intolerable and abstinence is an effective response to the growing crisis of drug addiction
		and crime (Tupper, 2008b).
	</p>
	<p>
		The repeal of Prohibition in 1933 signalled a change in emphasis from alcohol to
		illicit drug prevention (Midford et al., 2001). During this time, drug education was
		actually discouraged because this might arouse the curiosity of individuals and lead them
		to experiment with drug use. In addition, starting at that time, movies were being
		produced that sent the message to the audience about the purported evils of drugs such as
		cocaine and marijuana. So the emphasis of drug education during this period shifted
		from conveying the message that drug use is wrong to arousing fear in potential users
		(Valverde, 1995). But the fear-arousal approach neither works nor leads to appropriate
		behavioral changes unless specific actions are recommended that will overcome or
		reduce the fear that is aroused (Flay & Sobel, 1983).
		The period from the 1950s to the early 1960s was a time of relatively little
		education about any drugs other than alcohol and, to a certain extent, tobacco (Tupper,
		2008b). However, the relative domestic tranquility of that time gave way to dramatic
		social disturbances in the areas of gender and generational relationships, civil rights, and
		socioeconomic class differences (Wilson & Kolander, 2000). This led to a rise in drug
		use, especially in the developed world, that would peak in the 1970s. As Tupper (2008b)
		observed: 
	</p>
	<p>
		"With the rise in illegal drug use among young people that occurred in
		most developed countries in the 1960s, the perceived need to scare young
		people away from experimentation with these substances again became a
		prominent issue for education. However, changing attitudes about
		drugs—including increased cross-cultural and historical awareness of
		human drug use and postmodern sensibilities of tolerance—made it more
		difficult to uphold the arbitrary distinction between alcohol and ''drugs,''
		defined more through past legal and policy contingencies than through
		scientific or public health considerations."
	</p>
	<p>
		The information-dissemination approach remains to be the primary approach to
		drug education. However, instead of emphasizing the evil of drug use or using scare
		tactics to dissuade drug use, drug education in the 1960s focused primarily on providing
		factual information about the drugs and their harmful effects in the hope of promoting
		negative attitudes toward drug use (Midford et al., 2001; Wilson & Kolander, 2000). But
		research has shown that neither scare tactics nor information-dissemination was effective
		in reducing drug use (e.g. Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Kinder et al., 1980; Tobler et al.,
		2000). In addition, the vast number of drug education programmes that were planned
		during that time were implemented in a haphazard and uncoordinated manner.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 1970s saw the introduction of affective education approaches to the drug
		problem that sought to reduce drug use by enhancing interpersonal and intrapersonal
		skills including self-esteem, assertion, communication, decision making and goal setting
		skills (Midford et al., 2001; Guzys & Kendall, 2006). This was made possible by the
		development of Social Learning Theory by Albert Bandura that stresses the mutual
		interrelationships among behavior, internal causes, and environmental factors (Ewen,
		2003; Sharma, 2005). Add to this, the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug
		Abuse recommended a moratorium on school drug education as it had failed to halt youth
		drug use. But as is the case with information-dissemination approaches, affective
		education approaches also proved to be ineffective in reducing drug use (e.g. Kearney &
		Hines, 1980; Kim, 1988; Palinkas et al., 1996).
	</p>
	<p>
		In the late 1970s, alternative programs based on the idea of "natural highs"
		flourished. "Natural highs" were programs designed to provide a safe environment for
		high-risk activities such as river rafting and wilderness experiences (Wilson & Kolander,
		2000). Applied to drug education, this approach called for restructuring a part of an
		individual's environment in order to provide him with alternatives to substance use
		(Botvin & Griffin, 2005). The assumption was that if an individual could be provided
		with real-life experiences that were as appealing as drug use, then his involvement in
		those activities would take the place of his involvement in drug use. These alternative
		activities might include community service, academic tutoring, sports, hobbies, etc.
		There is very little research on the effectiveness of this approach and most seem to
		suggest that the approach is practically ineffective in preventing substance use.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the 1980s, many drug education programmes were developed that used social
		resistance skills approaches. Such approaches generally teaches students how to 
		recognize situations in which they will have a high probability of experiencing peer
		pressure to smoke, drink, or use drugs so that these situations could be avoided (Botvin &
		Griffin, 2005). They are also referred to as social influence or refusal skills approaches.
		A distinct feature of programmes using these approaches is the use of peer leaders as
		program facilitators, which has been shown to be promising, to say the least (Orme &
		Starkey, 1999). In contrast with the previous approaches, a number of studies have
		shown the effectiveness of social resistance skills approaches in reducing drug use (e.g.
		Cuijpers, 2002).
	</p>
	<p>
		Competence enhancement approaches integrate the cognitive, affective, and social
		influence approaches. Based on Social Learning Theory and Problem Behavior Theory,
		these approaches emphasize the use of proven cognitive-behavioral skills training
		methods (e.g. instruction, demonstration, feedback, reinforcement, homework) where two
		or more of the following are taught:
		- General problem-solving and decision-making skills,
		- General cognitive skills for resisting interpersonal or media influences,
		- Skills for increasing self-control and self-esteem,
		- Adaptive coping strategies for relieving stress and anxiety through the use of
		cognitive coping skills or behavioral relaxation techniques,
		- General social skills, and
		- General assertive skills (Botvin & Griffin, 2005).
		Research has shown that unless combined with social resistance skills training,
		competence enhancement approaches are not very effective.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recently, there has been considerable interest in the harm minimization or harm
		reduction approach to drug education. Harm reduction attempts to assess the actual harm
		associated with any drug and then asks how this could be minimized or reduced through a
		comprehensive set of strategies that include education, treatment, and drug control
		(Guzys & Kendall, 2006). There is some resistance to this approach because it is widely
		seen as an alternative to abstinence and thus condones, if not encourages, drug use
		(Midford et al., 1998).
	</p>
	<p>
		The latest developments in psychology and related disciplines are also finding
		applications in preventive drug education. For example, taking off from a humanistic
		springboard, "Drugsbridge" was proposed as a drug education programme designed to
		facilitate and empower informed choice in relation to drug issues, and to improve
		communication between young people and parents when discussing drug issues (Mallick
		& Watts, 2007). Using the Health Belief Model as basis, Gonzalez (1990) designed a
		drug education course that aims at increasing the students' awareness of the severity of
		alcohol and other drug problems, how they are personally susceptible to these problems,
		and what behavioral options they have available to reduce the risk of alcohol and other
		drug-related problems. The Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned
		Behavior were developed by Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen to examine the relationship 
		between belief and attitude, and to predict behavioral intention and behavior (Sharma &
		Kanekar, 2007).
	</p>
	<p>
		The constructs in the Adult Education Model proposed by Paulo Freire—
		dialogue, conscientization, praxis, transformation, and critical consciousness—could also
		be applied in alcohol and drug education (Sharma, 2003). The Precaution Adoption
		Process Model takes into account the different stages in which people might be with
		regard to the adoption of a risky behavior (Sharma, 2007). Thus tailor-made or
		customized interventions could be prepared for an individual depending on the stage that
		he is in. A modification of Kumpfer and Turner's Social Ecological Model (1990-1991)
		provided the theoretical framework for a study that examined the relationships among
		drug use, self-esteem, family climate, family and peer drug abuse, and self-efficacy
		(Finke et al., 2002). That study reported success in teaching children survival skills to
		resist the use of drugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even emerging theories and methods from other social sciences could positively
		contribute to drug education. For example, Capability Theory, developed by economist
		and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, which emphasizes the individual's opportunities to
		make use of his available resources in order to achieve well-being as opposed to having
		his well-being shaped by the use of goods that he is able to acquire because of his income
		(Sharma, 2004). It was also proposed that a historical approach to drug education where
		archival materials (e.g. newspapers, government documents, old periodicals) can be used
		to provide a better understanding of the nature of the drug problem and the numerous
		policies formulated over time (Cintron & Roth, 2001). The visual and performing arts
		have been used as avenues to communicate messages about drug use (Macdonald &
		Nehammer, 2003).
