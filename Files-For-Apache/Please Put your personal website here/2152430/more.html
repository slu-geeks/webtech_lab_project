            Hello there, my name is
            <b>Mon Joel</b> ...
            <i>

        <p>
            I am a student of Saint Louis University,<br>I'm taking up Bachelor Of Science In Information
            Technology, currently on my Third Year Second Semester.<br>I have created this web page for
            you guys to know me better..
            <br><br>
            I'm just a simple guy with simple dream of passing all my subject this semester
            especially Webtech laboratory and lecture.
            <br><br>
            I believe in my own saying that...<br>
            <u><q>Addiction can lead to DESTRUCTION but it may also lead to PERFECTION !!</q></u>
            <br>Which is quite true at least for me, because if you for example become addicted to gaming,
            you most probably will spend most of your time on playing online. Which in return can harm you
            in many ways, one example is that it will prevent you from going out of the house and physically
            interacting with your real life friends and it can also prevent you from doing some exercise which
            can definitely result to a healthier life. Lastly the most common reason that gaming can lead to
            destruction is because gaming is so expensive and time consuming, but we cannot deny the fact that
            as you do gaming constantly on a daily basis you actually become more and more familiar with that
            specific game that you're currently playing. As a result you master everything about it like place,
            spot, character movements etc.. In short you actually mastered and perfected the way on how to play
            that specific game that you're addicted with correctly.
