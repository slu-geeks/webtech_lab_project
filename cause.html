    <h1> Why do people loves to drink alcohol?</h1>
    <p> We have interviewed some people regarding "Why do the love to drink?" and these are common answers: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> It serves as a good time when you're stressed.</li>
        <li> It serves as a cure to your problems.</li>
        <li> It makes you look cool.</li>
        <li> Because all of your friends are drinking.</li>

    <h3> IT SERVES A GOOD TIME WHEN YOU'RE STRESSED.</h3>
    <img class="photo-right" src=static-contents/images/stress.jpg alt="A Stressed Guy" height="510">
    <p> We all know that being addicted to alcohol is a bad habit, and being addicted to it is considered drug abuse.
        But
        why do
        people get so addicted with alcohols? It is because sometimes, especially among men, find drinking a good time
        because of
        stress. They think that by drinking, it will lessen their stress. But the truth is: using alcohol as
        a good
        time will lead them to get drunk and do crazy things which they won't the next day. </p>

<section id="cause-sec2">
    <h3> IT SERVES AS A CURE TO YOUR PROBLEMS.</h3>
    <img class="photo-right" src=static-contents/images/problem.jpg alt="Has a Family Problem">
    <p>Some people have considered alcohol as the cure to their problems because when they drink alcohol, they think
        that
        they would forget all their little and big problems, but the truth is even you drink a lot of alcohol just to
        forget
        about all
        the problems you are encountering, you will never escape it. This is just another side effect of
        alcohol
        ; if you woke up the next day the problem will still be there.</p>

<section id="cause-sec3">
    <h3> IT MAKES YOU LOOK COOL </h3>
    <img class="photo-right" src=static-contents/images/cool.jpg alt="A guys feels cool">
    <p>Some people consider drinking alcohol as cool, most especially this generation; the youth thinks
        that
        all the bad habits are cool, but they're wrong, because the truth is alcohol won't make you cool at all. In fact
        it
        will make you uncool especially when you get drunk and do things like get loud or telling something to someone
        that isn't true.</p>
</section>

<section id="cause-sec4">
    <h3> BECAUSE ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE DRINKING. </h3>
    <img class="photo-left" src=static-contents/images/friends.jpg alt="Drinking with friends">
    <p>Another reason is that people love alcohol because of all of their drinking friends. I think it is not an excuse
        to
        drink
        just because your friend drinks, because if your friends are real friends and they know that you don't drink.
        , they
        won't let you drink, and it doesn't matter if you're the only one who doesn't drink because you'll be healthier
        than them.</p>
