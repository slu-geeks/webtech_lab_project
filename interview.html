    <h3> Why use cigarettes?</h3>
    <p>- One friend told me that he uses cigarettes, because he saw it from his other friends, he thinks that it's cool
        until he realizes that he's being addicted to it and keep on smoking with his friends. </p>
    <p>-Another friend said that it is a bond between friends if you smoke cigarettes, you all come along and smoke
        cigarettes when it's a break time and you share your ideas or converse with them and it is fun so they smoke and
        get
        addicted or get used to it. </p>
    <p>-Another told me that it can take all your problems away, like it can temporarily cure stress and everything, it
        can
        also help solve problems in your situation. It can be addicting because it's a temporary escape from stress and
        their problems that is why they are addicted to it and until now, they smoke cigarettes without knowing the
        effects
        on their body. They only focus on the mind and not the body.

    <h3> Why use marijuana?</h3>
    <p>
        -People whom I interviewed told me that they are using it because of stress, same case in cigarettes but the
        effect
        of marijuana is stronger and it lasts longer, which makes it addictive. Others told me that it can make you
        intelligent, get higher on grades and thinking, in which is partially correct because they told me if that you
        use
        this marijuana it makes you wonder on how things are going, like reality, politics, nature, space, time and deep
        stuff that a normal person wouldn't randomly think about it. </p>
    <p>- Other friends told me that they use this as a medical treatment from their sickness, like pneumonia, Parkinson
        disease, epilepsy, arthritis, and others. It can calm their nervous system, which they told me; because of the
        THC
        (tetra hydra cannabinol), it can stimulate the brain and calm them down.</p>
    <p>- Some friends also told me that it could help relax your body and mind; it can help you sleep more and stay cool
        for
        the day. They told me it's just that great to use this marijuana, because it helps people chill down, without
        worrying about anything, it's addictive but we are not abusing it, they say. They told me that using this
        marijuana
        is good for the heart as long as you're not abusing this drug, but who knows?</p>
    <p>- Another friend told me that it can make you happy and energetic, in which you only think of the happy thoughts
        and
        leaving the bad things behind him, it's like living the happy moment and it can make you remember all the happy
        thoughts that you had in the past. â€œIt can also unravel of what you love doing, and hate the things that you
        hate
        doing, it's like a key to your gate in which you can see what you love and what you hate. He said.</p>

    <h3> Drug abuse</h3>
    <p>Abuse of Shabu
        -I had a friend that knew an abuser of shabu, and that it destroyed his mind and body, that his thinking was
        dangerous and his body got thinner after abusing all those chemicals to his body. It's dangerous and horrifying
        to
        see a friend to be eaten by a drug that is so dangerous, it's like I lost a brother, he said. He also said that
        being addicted to it would make you poor and you will steal money or sell everything you have as long as you
        have
        that chemical (shabu) and that you are fine. He said that his friend would kill only for that chemical (shabu).
