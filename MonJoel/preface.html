        <br>tobacco or drugs. Especially for us here in the philippines, wherein according to <b>Jodesz Gavilan</b> of <i>rappler</i> we have an estimated number of 1.8 million current drug users which is around 2% of the current philippine population. Which is quite scary because despite of all the action that was done by <b>president Duterte</b> to suppress and eliminate all the drugs here in the philippines, this number is still too much, but there's also no denying of the fact that we are currently on the verge of a major break through to a drug free country thank to our current President <b>Rodrigo Duterte.</b>&nbsp Ever since <b>Duterte</b> started the war on drugs, the Philippines had been the center of all the media around the world when it come to drug suppression, because of all the killing or extra judicial killings a term that was used by his critics.
